I have a good proficiency in *python* language and Datascience basics.

***Python:***
- Datatypes
  1. Strings
  2. Tuples
  3. Lists 
  4. Dictionaries 
  5. Numbers
      - Integers
      - Float
      - Decimal
      - Boolean
- Python Operators
- Flow Control
- Loops
- Regular Expressions
- Functions
- Object Oriented Programming
- Exception Handling
- ***Libraries that I have used in my projects and have good knowlegde about them***
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- tkinter
- pillow
- Scikit -learn
- Scipy
And exploring many more everyday through web and MOOC.


***OpenCV:***

 I am currently Learning about OpenCV from MOOC and I have selected this because I wanted to explore more about it. I would be able perform well with a good mentorship.
 I have studied about it for my Final year project so  I have idea about how to get started with it.
 I have searched the web to get to know more about OpenCV  and this are things that I got know.

 1.OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
 2. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.
 3. When it integrated with various libraries, such as Numpuy, python is capable of processing the OpenCV array structure for analysis. 
 4. To Identify image pattern and its various features we use vector space and perform mathematical operations on these features.
